1. Compile and install on *nix systems

To compile ejabberd, go to the main directory and execute the command:
  make
    or
  ./rebar compile


Ta install ejabberd, run this command with system administrator rights
(root user):bberd release:
  make rel
    or
  ./rebar generate

 These commands will generate a self-contained OTP system image in
 project's rel/ejabberd subdirectory. Contents of that directory look as
 follows:
  - rel/ejabberd/bin - administration scripts
  - rel/ejabberd/etc - configuration files
  - rel/ejabberd/lib - ejabberd binary, header and runtime files
  - rel/ejabberd/var - spool directory
  - rel/ejabberd/log - log file directory
  - rel/ejabberd/releases - release files directory

To install ejabberd just copy the entire rel/ejabberd directory to
a place you find suitable.

2. Start ejabberd

You can use the ejabberdctl command line administration script to
start and stop ejabberd. For example:  
  ejabberd console

Running it without arguments will show you available possibilities.
